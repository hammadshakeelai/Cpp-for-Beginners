//	Book Class
//	a. Some of the characteristics of a book are the 
title, 
author, 
publisher, 
ISBN, 
price, and 
year of publication. 
//  Design the class Book that defines the book as an ADT. Each object of the class
//	Book can hold the following information about a book: title, author, publisher, ISBN, price,
//	year of publication, and number of copies in stock.
//	
//	Include the methods to perform various operations on the objects of Book. For example, the
//	usual operations that can be performed on the title are to show the title, set the title. Similarly,
//	the typical operations that can be performed on the number of copies in stock are to show the
//	number of copies in stock, set the number of copies in stock, update the number of copies in
//	stock, and return the number of copies in stock. Add similar operations for the publisher,
//	ISBN, book price, and authors. Add the appropriate constructors.
//	
//	b. Write a program that uses the class Book and tests various operations on the objects of class
//	Book. The objects must be created dynamically with the a Pointer of type Book.
